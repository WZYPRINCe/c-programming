# c-programming

C programming done for my computer architecture course (CS211) at Rutgers.

### Data Structures
Implemented linked list, hash table, binary search trees in C.

### One Shot Learning
Used linear algebra to train an algorithm with data about house attributes and prices.
Calculated weight of each attribute (year built, etc.) on the house price using linear algebra.
Predicted prices of houses based on those weights for house with specific attributes.
